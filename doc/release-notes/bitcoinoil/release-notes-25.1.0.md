## How to Upgrade

The upgrade process for BitcoinOil is straightforward. Download the latest version from the [release page](https://github.com/escapeneo/bitcoinoil/releases/tag/v25.1.0). If you are upgrading from an older version, ensure the application is fully shut down before replacing the previous installation. 

- **On Windows**: Run the installer.
- **On macOS**: Copy over the `/Applications/BitcoinOil-Qt` file.
- **On Linux**: Replace the `bitcoinoild` and `bitcoinoil-qt` binaries as needed.

Older wallet versions are generally supported, though certain data migrations may require additional time when upgrading from a much earlier version.

## Compatibility

BitcoinOil is extensively tested on Linux, macOS 10.15+, and Windows 7 or newer. While it is expected to work on other Unix-like systems, official support is limited to the platforms mentioned.

## Consensus and Protocol Changes | Security and Stability Improvements

- **Soft Fork Activation Controls**: This release includes improved control mechanisms for soft fork activations, allowing for smoother integration of consensus rule updates at specified block heights without requiring hard forks.

- **Enhanced Version Bits Management**: New controls for version bits improve compatibility with future protocol adjustments, reducing the likelihood of network splits or unintentional hard forks.

- **Taproot Compatibility and Future Upgrade Readiness**: This version introduces the necessary groundwork to ensure compatibility with Taproot and other anticipated consensus changes. These enhancements are drawn from Bitcoin's v25 improvements and adapted for BitcoinOilâ€™s ecosystem.

## Notable Changes
